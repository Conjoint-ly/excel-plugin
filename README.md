## üìâ Elasticity Function
`=ELASTICITY(Quantity1, Quantity2, Price1, Price2)`

Price elasticity of demand (PED) is a measurement of how quantity demanded is affected by changes in price, i.e. it shows how demand for a product increases or decreases as its price increases or decreases. 

This function calculates the [coefficient of price elasticity of demand](https://conjointly.com/guides/understanding-price-elasticity-of-demand) using the mid-point formula.

üí° **Handy Tip:** If you forget the list of arguments in this function, press `Ctrl+A`.
